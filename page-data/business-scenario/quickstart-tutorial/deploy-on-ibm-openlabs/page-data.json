Go to [IBM OpenLabs](https://developer.ibm.com/openlabs/openshift) in a browser and click on `Launch Lab` button for **Lab 6**.\n\n  ![OpenLabs1](images/openLabs1.png)\n\n1. Sign in with your IBM Cloud account or register for an IBM Cloud account.\n\n  ![OpenLabs2](images/openLabs2.png)\n\n1. You will be presented with a dialog asking you whether you have an **Opportunity Id** or not. If you don't have it or don't no, just select **No** and click on **Launch Lab**.\n\n1. You should now see your IBM OpenLabs environment.\n\n  ![OpenLabs4](images/openLabs4.png)\n\n1. On the left hand side navigation menu, click on the **Quick Links and Common Commnads** section. Now, if you scroll down on the instructions shown on your screen, you should reach the **Commonly Used Command** section of these and in there you should see an `oc login ...` command to get your terminal associated to this IBM OpenLabs Lab 6 logged into the OpenShift cluster that you will be working with for this quickstart tutorial. Click on the `oc login...` command and you should see a `Login successful` message on the terminal.\n\n  ![OpenLabs8](images/openLabs8.png)\n\n1. In the terminal associated to your lab, download the [kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/tree/master/scripts/kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh) file:\n\n  ```\n  curl -o kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/master/scripts/kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh\n  chmod +x kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh\n  ```\n\n  <br/>\n\n  ![OpenLabs9](images/openLabs9.png)\n\n1. Execute the quickstart deployment script with the following command:\n\n  ```\n  ./kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh --skip-login\n  ```\n  **IMPORTANT:** do not forget the **- -skip-login** flag since we have already logged into the RedHat OpenShift cluster above.\n\n1. Wait for the deployment to be active and ready when you are prompted with `Press any key to continue once an order has been submitted...`.\n\n  ![OpenLabs10](images/openLabs10.png)\n\n1. Grab the User Interface Microservice url and credentials and open it up in your web browser.\n\n  ![OpenLabs11](images/openLabs11.png)\n\n   _(\\*) This will be referred to as_ `kc-ui-shipping.cluster.local` _in the step 2 of this quickstart._\n\n1. You can also check all the resources created by the `kcontainer-quickstart-ocp.sh` script in the RedHat OpenShift console by clicking on the OpenShift web console quick link presented at the top of the instructions section of the OpenLabs Lab6 website.\n\n  ![OpenLabs5](images/openLabs5.png)\n\n1. You should now see your OpenShift web console.\n\n  ![OpenLabs7](images/openLabs7.png)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**[Move on to run the demo!](./run-the-demo/)**\n\n_This quickstart guide will be updated as the project evolves and new capability is added. If you have any issues or queries with this quickstart guide, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/issues) in the github repo._\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"0f5b09fb532f3f47bc46829e286d8b89","counter":351,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quickstart Tutorial","description":"Simple end-to-end deployment scenario for the KContainer Shipping Container Reference Implementation.","tabs":["Introduction","Deploy on IBM OpenLabs","Deploy on OpenShift Playgrounds","Run the Demo"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Quickstart Tutorial\ndescription: Simple end-to-end deployment scenario for the KContainer Shipping Container Reference Implementation.\ntabs: ['Introduction', 'Deploy on IBM OpenLabs', 'Deploy on OpenShift Playgrounds', 'Run the Demo']\n---\n\n## Deploy the reference implementation\n\n### IBM OpenLabs\n\nIn this section, we are going to see how to deploy the KContainer Shipping Container Reference Implementation on IBM OpenLabs.\n\n1.
